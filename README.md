## Questions

* What was the hardest thing you had to solve while building the website?

I had to figure out how HTML forms interacted with an express POST endpoint, which I didn't know how to work beforehand, it took me a little while to make everything work correctly, but it was a great learning experience.

* Are there any areas of your code that you think isn't that "clean"?

I think the HTML part of the code is not as clean as I would prefer, there are surely much better ways to make a dynamic table and contain the various variables, but in order to make better use of my time, it is not as good as I would like.

Other than that, I would prefer to organize things a little bit better and add more design details but those can be easily modified.

* If you weren't able to finish: what were you able to complete and were you happy with your progress given the time constraints?

I was able to finish everything, the only thing I couldn't finish was the gallery due to time constraints. However everything else works perfectly fine, even if some small design details could be made much better.
